# I <3 Reporting

Nobody _really_ loves reporting, but with a few tips and tricks the sting can be lessened somewhat. This repository provides (will provide?! PRs welcome) guidance for all aspects of reporting, the most unloved and [important part of a penetration test](https://medium.com/@petergombos/what-makes-a-good-penetration-tester-32c075240c27).

These tips have been gleaned from years of report writing and fellow travellers of the hellish road. I've tried to give credit where credit is due, but if I've missed something, please let me know so I can correct.
