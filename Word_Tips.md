# Word Tips

## Styles

Word's styles allow you to define the appearance of a block of text. Once defined, you can save the style for future use.

* To create a style, format the text as you'd like to keep it, then right-click and then choose **Styles > Create a Style**.
* You can disable spell-checking for a style by modifying it and then choosing **Format > Language > Do not check spelling or grammar**.
* You can copy a style by using `CTRL + SHIFT + C` and then apply it elsewhere using `CTRL + SHIFT + V`.

## Layout

* Use **Paragraph > Line and Page Breaks > Keep with next** to bind a block of text to the following paragraph. Great for introductory bits.
* Rather than inserting manual newlines to move text to a new page, hit `CTRL + ENTER` to insert a page break. *@prime*
* If you'd like to add a bit of breathing room before or after a line, click **Paragraph > Line and Paragraph Spacing > Add a Space Before/After Paragraph**.

## Tables

* If your table splits across pages, right-click it and then choose **Properties > Row > Repeat as header row at the top of each page**. *@prime*

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Action | Shortcut |
|---|---|
| Highlight text | `ALT + H, I, <ENTER>`|
| Remove highlighting | `ALT + H, I, N`|
| Add a comment | `ALT + R, C`|
