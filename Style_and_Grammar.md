# Style and Grammar

## Numbers

Numbers less than 10, always with letters. Larger numbers, always with numbers.
Unless it's with a unit.

Examples:

* "We downloaded 5 GB of data from the server"
* "We found three instances of remote code execution"
* "By cracking password hashes, 5,000 users had the password 'Summer2019'"
